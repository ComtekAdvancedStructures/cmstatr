    cmstatr: An R Package for Statistical Analysis of Composite Material
    Data
---

# Summary

A number of statistical techniques are commonly used when analyzing
strength datat for composite materials used in aerospace applications.
Currently, most users use MS Excel spreadsheets for performing this
analysis. `cmstatr` is an R package that implements the statistical
analysis techniques commonly used for composite material strength data.

A set of statistical methods are described in CMH-17-1G [@CMH171G]. The
use of these methods is widely accepted by industry and civil aviation
regulators.
