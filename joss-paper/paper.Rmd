# Summary
A number of statistical techniques are commonly used when analyzing
strength datat for composite materials used in aerospace applications,
such as carbon fiber and fiberglass.
Currently, many users use MS Excel spreadsheets for performing this
analysis. `cmstatr` is an R package that implements the statistical
analysis techniques commonly used for composite material strength data.

A set of statistical methods are described in CMH-17-1G [@CMH171G].
The use of these methods is widely accepted by industry and civil
aviation regulators.
