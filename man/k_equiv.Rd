k_equiv(alpha, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{the acceptable probability of a type I error}

\description{
k-factors for determining acceptance based on sample mean and an extremum
}
\details{
The k-factors returned by this function are used for determining
  whether to accept a new dataset.

  This function is used as part of the procedure for
  determining acceptance limits for a sample mean and sample minimum.
  These acceptance limits are often used to set acceptance limits for
  material strength for each lot of material, or each new manufacturing
  site. When a sample meets the criteria that its mean and its minimum are
  both greater than these limits, then one may accept the lot of material
  or the new manufacturing site.

  According to Vangel (2002), the use of mean and extremum for this purpose
  is more powerful than the use of mean and standard deviation.

  The results of this function match those published by Vangel within
  0.05\% for \eqn{n > 2} and \eqn{\alpha \le 0.25}. Those results published
  by Vangel are identical to those published in CMH-17-1G.

  This function uses numerical integration and numerical optimization to
  find values of the factors \eqn{k_1} and \eqn{k_2} based on Vangel's
  saddle point approximation.

  The value \eqn{n} refers to the number of observations in the sample
  being compared with the original population (the qualification sample is
  usually assumed to be equal to the population statistics).

  The value of \eqn{alpha} is the acceptable probability of a type I error.
  Normally, this is set to 0.05 for material or process equivalency and 0.01
  when setting lot acceptance limits. Though, in principle, this parameter
  can be set to any number between 0 and 1. This function, however, has only
  been validated in the range of \eqn{1e-5 \le alpha \le 0.5}.
