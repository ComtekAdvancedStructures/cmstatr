\title{significance level for the Anderson-Darling test statistic}
\usage{
ad_p(z, n, abs_tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{the test statistic}

\item{n}{the sample size}

\item{abs_tol}{the requested accuracy of the calculation}
}
\value{
the significance level.
}
\description{
Calculates the significance level from an Anderson-Darling
test statistic.
}
\details{
\code{ad_p_inf} uses the limiting distribution (i.e. for infinite sample
size). \code{ad_p} applies a correction for sample size. Since the
Anderson-Darling test statistic converges very quickly, the correction
only has a practical effect for very small sample sizes (around 5 or less).
Nevertheless, it is recommended that \code{ad_p} be used as the correction
is not computationally intensive to apply.

The method of Marsaglia and Marsaglia is used to compute the significance
level. See references below.
